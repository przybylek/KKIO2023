    <p><strong>KKIO</strong> is a series of software engineering conferences, organized under the auspices of the Polish Information Processing Society since 1999 (<a className='u' href='https://kkio.pti.org.pl/2022/past-editions/'>see all past editions</a>), with the mission to promote international collaboration within the field of software engineering, artificial intelligence and related areas.</p>

    <p>The conference invites researchers and practitioners to submit papers concerning emerging challenges and solutions for software engineering industry. A particular focus on validation and/or demonstration of practical applications of the proposed approaches and solutions is expected, although we welcome also novel fundamental approaches.
</p>

    <p>As a result, <strong>KKIO</strong> intends to be a forum for presenting the practical aspects of software engineering relevant to the IT industry (including challenges and needs), research ideas and solutions aimed at addressing such aspects, and a place to establish the cooperation between scientific and industrial partners.
</p>

    <p>The scope of the <strong>KKIO 2023</strong> conference includes a wide range of areas related to software engineering (outlined in conference topics list), as the practically-oriented proposals applicable to any SE area are welcome. The conference also invites experience reports from various sectors of the IT industry.
